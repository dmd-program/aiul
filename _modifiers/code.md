## CO (Code)

This modifier indicates that the assignment involves programming or software development, where AI coding assistants or code generation tools might be applicable.

### Applicable Tools
- Code completion tools (GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer)
- Large language models for code generation
- Automated code explanation or documentation tools
- Debugging assistants
- Code refactoring and optimization tools

### Considerations
- Consider whether understanding core programming concepts or producing functional software is more important
- Distinguish between using AI for boilerplate code versus core logic implementation
- Be specific about which aspects of development can use AI assistance
- Programming assignments may benefit from requiring comments explaining AI-generated code
- Consider requirements for testing and validating AI-generated code
