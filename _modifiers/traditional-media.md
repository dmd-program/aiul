## TR (Traditional Media)

This modifier indicates that the assignment involves physical art media, where AI might be used for planning, reference, or documentation rather than direct creation.

### Applicable Tools
- Reference image generators
- Composition planning tools
- Color palette generators
- Style reference systems
- Documentation and digitization assistants

### Considerations
- Traditional media assignments typically involve physical creation where AI serves a supporting role
- Consider allowing AI for planning stages even when the execution must be entirely manual
- Be clear about expectations for reference images (AI-generated vs. found)
- Documentation of process and final work may involve AI tools separate from the creation itself
