# 3D Design v1.0.0

## Overview

The **3D Design** domain covers work involving three-dimensional modeling, animation, virtual environments, and related spatial design activities.

## Scope

This modifier applies to assignments and projects involving:

- 3D modeling and sculpting
- Character design and animation
- Game design and virtual reality
- Architectural visualization
- Product visualization
- Procedural geometry
- Texture mapping and material creation
- Motion capture and animation
- Rendering and lighting design

## Applicable AI Tools

When declaring AI usage in 3D Design, consider these tool categories:

- **Text-to-3D Model Generators** - Generate 3D models from text prompts
- **AI-Assisted Modeling Tools** - Interactive 3D modeling with AI suggestions
- **Automated Rigging Systems** - Skeleton and bone automation
- **Motion Capture Assistance** - AI-enhanced animation and motion data
- **Texture & Material Generators** - Procedural or AI-generated surfaces
- **Environment Creation Tools** - Procedural landscape and space generation
- **Rendering & Lighting AI** - Automated lighting optimization

## Considerations

- 3D work often involves technical challenges where AI assistance can be valuable for overcoming blockers
- Consider whether understanding of 3D principles or final output quality is the primary learning objective
- Complex projects may require different AI usage levels for different components (e.g., modeling vs. rigging)
- Some aspects like UV mapping or optimization might benefit from AI assistance even when other elements are restricted

## Related Usage Levels

Pair this domain with a usage level to create a full declaration:

- **[Ideation & Brainstorming](/usage-levels/ideation/1.0.0/)** - AI for concept exploration before modeling
- **[Assistance & Debugging](/usage-levels/assistance/1.0.0/)** - AI to solve technical problems in your 3D work
- **[Content Generation](/usage-levels/generation/1.0.0/)** - AI for substantial model or asset creation
- **[Refinement & Polish](/usage-levels/refinement/1.0.0/)** - AI for optimization, texturing, or final rendering
