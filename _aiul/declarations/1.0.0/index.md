# AI Usage Declaration v1.0.0

## Overview

The AI Usage Declaration is a standardized system for transparently describing how artificial intelligence tools were used in creative and academic work. It enables students, researchers, and creators to clearly communicate their usage across different domains and usage levels.

## System Components

The declaration system combines two dimensional classifications:

### 1. Domains / Media Types
The type of content or work being created:

- [3D Design](/modifiers/3d/1.0.0/) - Three-dimensional design work
- [Audio](/modifiers/audio/1.0.0/) - Sound design and audio production
- [Code](/modifiers/code/1.0.0/) - Software development
- [Image](/modifiers/image/1.0.0/) - Visual graphics and photography
- [Mixed Media](/modifiers/mixed-media/1.0.0/) - Combination of multiple media types
- [Traditional Media](/modifiers/traditional-media/1.0.0/) - Drawing, painting, sculpture, etc.
- [Video](/modifiers/video/1.0.0/) - Motion graphics and videography
- [Writing](/modifiers/writing/1.0.0/) - Text-based content

### 2. Usage Levels
The extent of AI involvement in the work:

- [Ideation & Brainstorming](/usage-levels/ideation/1.0.0/) - Used to generate ideas, concepts, or outlines, but not final content
- [Assistance & Debugging](/usage-levels/assistance/1.0.0/) - Used to fix errors, suggest improvements, or overcome blocks
- [Content Generation](/usage-levels/generation/1.0.0/) - Used to create substantial portions of the final deliverable
- [Refinement & Polish](/usage-levels/refinement/1.0.0/) - Used to edit, format, or style existing content

## How to Use

1. **Identify each domain** where you used AI tools in your project
2. **Select the usage level** that best describes your AI involvement for that domain
3. **Optionally document** the specific tools and details of how they were used
4. **Generate** a visual declaration or export the data in multiple formats (HTML, Markdown, SVG, PNG)

## Version History
