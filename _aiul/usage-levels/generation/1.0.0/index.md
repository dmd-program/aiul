# Content Generation v1.0.0

## Definition

AI tools are used to **create substantial portions of the final deliverable content**.

## When to Use This Level

Generation is the appropriate declaration when:

- Using AI image generators to create artwork (not just concept exploration)
- Using AI to write significant portions of an essay, article, or report
- Using AI to generate code that forms a major part of your project
- Using AI to create animations, music, or video content
- **The AI output forms the main deliverable**, even if you curate, edit, or select among options
- You rely on AI-generated content as a primary component of your work

## Examples

- Using DALL-E or Midjourney to generate the final artwork for a project
- Using ChatGPT to write substantial sections of a research paper
- Using GitHub Copilot to generate 50%+ of your codebase
- Using AI video tools to create animations
- Using AI music generators for soundtrack creation
- Using image-to-image AI to transform or generate visual content

## What This Does NOT Include

- Only using AI for ideation or brainstorming (that's **Ideation**)
- Only using AI to debug or improve minor aspects (that's **Assistance**)
- Using AI only for final editing/formatting (that's **Refinement**)
- Manually creating the majority with minor AI assistance (that's **Assistance**)

## Important Distinction

The **Content Generation** level is not a judgment about quality or effort. It's a factual statement about the primary source of your deliverable. Using AI to generate content can still require significant:

- Creative direction and curation
- Prompt engineering and iteration
- Post-processing and refinement
- Artistic judgment and selection

- [Audio]({{ '/modifiers/audio/1.0.0/' | relative_url }})
- [Code]({{ '/modifiers/code/1.0.0/' | relative_url }})
- [Image]({{ '/modifiers/image/1.0.0/' | relative_url }})
- [Mixed Media]({{ '/modifiers/mixed-media/1.0.0/' | relative_url }})

- [Video]({{ '/modifiers/video/1.0.0/' | relative_url }})
- [Writing]({{ '/modifiers/writing/1.0.0/' | relative_url }})

## Transparency Best Practices

When declaring Generation usage:

1. **Be clear about the percentage** - how much of the final work is AI-generated?
2. **Explain your process** - what prompts did you use? How many iterations?
3. **Document your curation** - what did you keep, change, or discard from the AI output?
4. **Show post-processing** - what refinements or modifications did you apply?
5. **Provide context** - was this a constraint of the assignment, or your choice?
