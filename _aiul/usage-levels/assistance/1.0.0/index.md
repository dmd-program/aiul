# Assistance & Debugging v1.0.0

## Definition

AI tools are used to **fix errors, suggest improvements, or overcome technical blocks** in work that is primarily created by the human.

## When to Use This Level

Assistance is the appropriate declaration when:

- Using AI to debug code or troubleshoot technical errors
- Using AI to proofread or correct grammar/syntax
- Using AI to suggest optimizations or improvements to existing work
- Using AI to learn new techniques or understand how something works
- Using AI to overcome a specific technical blocker
- **The work is fundamentally yours**, but AI helped you improve or complete it
- Using AI tools for quality assurance or testing

## Examples

- Using ChatGPT to debug a Python error (but writing the code yourself)
- Using GitHub Copilot to suggest better variable names (but writing the logic)
- Using Grammarly to correct grammar (but writing the text)
- Using AI to optimize rendering settings (but creating the scene)
- Using AI to suggest composition improvements (but making the final artistic decision)

## What This Does NOT Include

- Using AI to generate the initial content (that's **Generation**)
- Using AI only to brainstorm (that's **Ideation**)
- Using AI to substantially rewrite or restructure your work (that's **Refinement** or **Generation**)
- Minor polishing or formatting (that's **Refinement** or **Generation** depending on scope)

## Related Domains

Pair this usage level with a domain to create a full declaration:

- [3D Design]({{ '/modifiers/3d/1.0.0/' | relative_url }})
- [Audio]({{ '/modifiers/audio/1.0.0/' | relative_url }})
- [Code]({{ '/modifiers/code/1.0.0/' | relative_url }})
- [Image]({{ '/modifiers/image/1.0.0/' | relative_url }})
- [Mixed Media]({{ '/modifiers/mixed-media/1.0.0/' | relative_url }})
- [Traditional Media]({{ '/modifiers/traditional-media/1.0.0/' | relative_url }})
- [Video]({{ '/modifiers/video/1.0.0/' | relative_url }})
- [Writing]({{ '/modifiers/writing/1.0.0/' | relative_url }})

## Transparency Best Practices

When declaring Assistance usage:

1. **Identify the problem** - what specifically needed fixing or improvement?
2. **Explain the solution** - what did AI suggest? Did you implement it as-is or modify it?
3. **Document the tool** - which AI tool did you use?
4. **Show understanding** - did you understand the fix, or did you blindly apply it?
5. **Note the percentage** - how much of the total work was assistance (e.g., "5% debugging, 95% original")?
