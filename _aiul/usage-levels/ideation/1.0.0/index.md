# Ideation & Brainstorming v1.0.0

## Definition

AI tools are used to **generate ideas, concepts, or outlines**, but not the final deliverable content.

## When to Use This Level

Ideation is the appropriate declaration when:

- Using AI to brainstorm project directions or creative concepts
- Generating outlines, mind maps, or conceptual frameworks
- Exploring multiple approaches before committing to one
- Using AI to overcome creative blocks or get unstuck
- Generating starting points or reference materials
- Creating mood boards or inspiration collections
- **The final work is substantially your own creation**, informed by AI-assisted ideation

## Examples

- Using ChatGPT to brainstorm essay thesis statements (but writing the essay yourself)
- Using AI image generators to explore visual style directions (but creating the final artwork)
- Using AI to suggest animation storyboard concepts (but storyboarding and animating yourself)
- Using generative tools to explore code architecture options (but implementing the final code)

## What This Does NOT Include

- Using AI to write the final essay (that's **Generation** or **Refinement**)
- Using AI to generate the final artwork (that's **Generation**)
- Using AI to create substantial portions of your deliverable (that's **Generation**)
- Using AI to debug or improve existing work (that's **Assistance**)

## Transparency Best Practices

When declaring Ideation usage:

1. **Be specific** about which tools you used (e.g., "ChatGPT 4.0 for brainstorming")
2. **Document your process** - what prompts did you use? What ideas did AI generate? Which ones did you pursue?
3. **Show the transformation** - how did AI's ideas become your own work?
4. **Acknowledge limitations** - did you use AI because you were stuck, or because it was genuinely useful?
