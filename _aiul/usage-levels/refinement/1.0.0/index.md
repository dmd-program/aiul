# Refinement & Polish v1.0.0

## Definition

AI tools are used to **edit, format, style, or polish content** that was substantially created by the human.

## When to Use This Level

Refinement is the appropriate declaration when:

- Using AI to edit or rewrite portions of text you wrote
- Using AI to optimize code style or performance (without changing functionality)
- Using AI to enhance image quality, resolution, or visual appeal
- Using AI for color correction, grading, or filter application
- Using AI for text formatting, layout, or typesetting
- Using AI for voice modulation or audio enhancement
- **The original work is substantially yours**, and AI adds finishing touches
- Using AI tools for spell-checking, style suggestions, or presentation enhancements

## Examples

- Using ChatGPT to improve the clarity of paragraphs you wrote
- Using AI upscaling tools to enhance image resolution
- Using color grading AI to enhance video or photography
- Using AI text formatters to restructure an outline
- Using auto-completion or suggestion features to speed up writing
- Using voice AI to enhance or modify audio recordings
- Using design AI to improve layout and typography

## What This Does NOT Include

- Using AI to write initial content (that's **Generation**)
- Using AI to fix broken code (that's **Assistance**)
- Using AI to explore design directions (that's **Ideation**)
- Using AI to make substantial changes to meaning or direction (that's **Generation**)

## Important Note

Refinement can blur into **Assistance** or **Generation** depending on scope. Use these guidelines:

- **Minor improvements** (grammar, formatting, simple rephrasing) = **Refinement**
- **Fixing problems** (broken code, unclear passages) = **Assistance**
- **Substantial changes** to structure, meaning, or content = **Generation**

## Transparency Best Practices

When declaring Refinement usage:

1. **Be specific** about what was refined (e.g., "grammar and sentence clarity")
2. **Show before and after** - what did the original look like?
3. **Quantify if possible** - what percentage of content was refined?
4. **Explain your choices** - did you accept all AI suggestions or select carefully?
5. **Note tool limitations** - what did you need to adjust or reject?
