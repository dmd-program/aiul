# AIUL-DP v1.0.0 - Directed Production

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Released:** December 9, 2025

The AIUL-DP (Directed Production) license designates assignments where **AI-assisted creation is permitted with clear direction and modification from the student**. This license allows students to use AI as a production tool while maintaining creative control through direction and post-processing.

## License Summary

- **Code:** DP
- **Full Name:** Directed Production
- **Short Description:** AI-assisted creation is permitted with clear direction and modification from the student.
- **Syllabus Text:** "you may use AI-assisted creation with clear direction and modification from you. The concept, direction, and post-processing should demonstrate your creative input."

## Purpose

This license establishes a framework for AI-assisted production that emphasizes the student's role in directing and refining the creative process. This approach is particularly valuable for:

- Developing skills in prompt engineering and AI direction
- Focusing on conceptual and editorial decision-making
- Learning to guide AI tools toward specific creative outcomes
- Understanding post-processing techniques for AI-generated content

## When to Use

Use AIUL-DP when:
- The focus is on concept, direction, and post-processing rather than initial creation
- You want to emphasize students' ability to guide and refine AI outputs
- Technical execution is less important than creative direction

## Requirements

Students under this license:
- May use AI tools to generate content under their direction
- Must provide clear creative direction to the AI tools
- Must apply post-processing and refinement to AI outputs
- Must document their prompts, direction process, and post-processing decisions

## Guidelines for Students

Under this license, students should:

- Provide clear, intentional direction to AI tools through careful prompt crafting
- Apply thoughtful post-processing and refinement to AI outputs
- Document the direction process, including prompt iterations and decisions
- Explain post-processing choices and their relationship to your creative vision
- Be prepared to discuss how your direction shaped the AI-generated elements

## Guidelines for Instructors

When using this license, instructors should:

- Focus evaluation on the quality of direction and post-processing, not raw generation
- Provide guidance on effective prompt engineering techniques
- Establish clear documentation requirements for the direction process
- Consider how to evaluate creative decision-making throughout the process
- Design assignments that emphasize conceptual development and creative guidance

## Documentation Requirements

Documentation should typically include:

1. Conceptual goals and creative vision for the project
2. Key prompts and direction provided to AI tools
3. Examples of iterations in the direction process
4. Detailed explanation of post-processing techniques applied
5. Reflection on how AI direction connects to broader creative decisions

## Example Use Cases

Use this license for visual arts, creative writing, and design assignments where AI can be used as a production tool guided by the student's creative vision.

## Domain Modifiers

AIUL-DP can be combined with domain modifiers to specify the type of work:

- [AIUL-DP-WR](/combinations/dp-wr/) - Writing assignments with directed production
- [AIUL-DP-IM](/combinations/dp-im/) - Image work with directed production
- [AIUL-DP-VD](/combinations/dp-vd/) - Video work with directed production
- [AIUL-DP-AU](/combinations/dp-au/) - Audio work with directed production
- [AIUL-DP-3D](/combinations/dp-3d/) - 3D work with directed production
- [AIUL-DP-TR](/combinations/dp-tr/) - Traditional media with directed production
- [AIUL-DP-MX](/combinations/dp-mx/) - Mixed media with directed production
- [AIUL-DP-CO](/combinations/dp-co/) - Code with directed production

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use AI to generate the majority of my content?**  
A: Yes, but the focus should be on your ability to direct the AI effectively and refine its outputs to match your creative vision.

**Q: What constitutes good "direction" of AI?**  
A: Effective direction typically involves clear prompt engineering, iterative refinement of prompts, and thoughtful selection/curation of outputs.

**Q: How much post-processing is expected?**  
A: Post-processing should be substantial enough to demonstrate your creative input and technical skills in refining AI outputs to match your vision.
