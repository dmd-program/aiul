# AIUL-IU v1.0.0 - Integrated Usage

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Released:** December 9, 2025

The AIUL-IU (Integrated Usage) license designates assignments where **AI usage is a required component**, with a focus on sophisticated AI integration and process documentation. This license is appropriate when working with AI tools is itself a core learning objective.

## License Summary

- **Code:** IU
- **Full Name:** Integrated Usage
- **Short Description:** AI usage is a required component of the assignment, with focus on sophisticated AI integration.
- **Syllabus Text:** "AI usage is a required component of this assignment. You are expected to demonstrate sophisticated use of AI tools and document your process thoroughly."

## Purpose

This license establishes a framework for assignments that explicitly engage with AI tools as a central component of the learning experience. This approach is particularly valuable for:

- Teaching AI literacy and technical fluency
- Examining AI capabilities and limitations
- Developing prompt engineering skills
- Exploring ethical considerations in AI usage
- Understanding AI-integrated creative workflows

## When to Use

Use AIUL-IU when:
- Learning to work with AI tools is a core objective
- The assignment specifically focuses on AI ethics, capabilities, or limitations
- Students need to demonstrate prompt engineering skills
- The course is specifically about AI-integrated creative practice

## Requirements

Students under this license:
- Must use AI tools as a significant component of the assignment
- Must demonstrate sophisticated and intentional AI usage
- Must thoroughly document their AI usage, including prompts and process
- Must reflect on the ethical implications and effectiveness of their AI integration

## Guidelines for Students

Under this license, students should:

- Use AI tools extensively and intentionally as part of the assignment
- Demonstrate sophisticated prompt engineering and AI interaction techniques
- Document their process thoroughly, including prompts, iterations, and decision-making
- Reflect critically on the effectiveness and implications of their AI usage
- Be prepared to discuss both technical and ethical dimensions of their work with AI

## Guidelines for Instructors

When using this license, instructors should:

- Provide clear guidance on expected AI tool usage
- Offer resources for developing prompt engineering skills
- Establish comprehensive documentation requirements
- Create opportunities for critical reflection on AI integration
- Design rubrics that evaluate both technical execution and conceptual understanding

## Documentation Requirements

Documentation should typically include:

1. Detailed description of AI tools and techniques employed
2. Full prompt history showing iteration and refinement process
3. Analysis of AI outputs and their integration into the final work
4. Critical reflection on successes, limitations, and ethical considerations
5. Connections between AI usage and broader learning objectives

## Example Use Cases

Use this license for assignments specifically focused on AI tools, prompt engineering exercises, AI ethics discussions, and projects where AI usage itself is a learning objective.
