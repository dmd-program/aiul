# AIUL-CD v1.0.0 - Conceptual Development

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Released:** December 9, 2025

The AIUL-CD (Conceptual Development) license designates assignments where **AI tools may be used for research and ideation, but the final work must be entirely student-generated**. This license allows AI to support the planning phase while ensuring the execution remains the student's own work.

## License Summary

- **Code:** CD
- **Full Name:** Conceptual Development
- **Short Description:** AI tools may be used for research and ideation, but the final work must be entirely student-generated.
- **Syllabus Text:** "you may use AI tools for research and idea generation, but the final work must be entirely your own. You must document any AI tools used in your process."

## Purpose

This license creates a balanced approach that harnesses AI for its strengths in information retrieval and idea generation while preserving the integrity of student-created work. This approach is particularly valuable for:

- Expanding research capabilities
- Supporting brainstorming and concept development
- Exploring multiple approaches before execution
- Learning to use AI as a research and ideation tool

## When to Use

Use AIUL-CD when:
- Students can benefit from AI-assisted research or ideation
- You want students to use AI for background knowledge or conceptual exploration
- Final execution should demonstrate the student's own technical abilities

## Requirements

Students under this license:
- May use AI tools only for research, ideation, and concept development
- The final work must be entirely created by the student without AI generation
- Must document which AI tools were used and how they contributed to the ideation process
- AI outputs may inform but not directly appear in the final work

## Guidelines for Students

Under this license, students should:

- Use AI tools to explore concepts, gather information, and develop ideas
- Document the AI tools used and how they contributed to the ideation process
- Create the final work entirely themselves, without AI-generated content
- Be prepared to discuss how AI-assisted research influenced their thinking
- Cite AI tools and prompts used in the research/ideation phase

## Guidelines for Instructors

When using this license, instructors should:

- Clarify the distinction between ideation and execution phases
- Provide examples of appropriate AI usage for conceptual development
- Establish clear documentation requirements for AI usage
- Consider how to evaluate the influence of AI on student thinking
- Design assignments that separate ideation from execution

## Documentation Requirements

Documentation should typically include:

1. Which AI tools were used
2. Key prompts or queries provided to the AI
3. How AI outputs informed the conceptual development
4. A reflection on how AI contributed to the ideation process
5. Clear delineation between AI-assisted ideation and student execution

## Example Use Cases

Use this license for research papers, creative briefs, project planning, and assignments where AI can help with background information but the execution should demonstrate student skills.

## Domain Modifiers

AIUL-CD can be combined with domain modifiers to specify the type of work:

- [AIUL-CD-WR](/aiul/combinations/cd-wr.html) - Writing assignments with conceptual development
- [AIUL-CD-IM](/aiul/combinations/cd-im.html) - Image work with conceptual development
- [AIUL-CD-VD](/aiul/combinations/cd-vd.html) - Video work with conceptual development
- [AIUL-CD-AU](/aiul/combinations/cd-au.html) - Audio work with conceptual development
- [AIUL-CD-3D](/aiul/combinations/cd-3d.html) - 3D work with conceptual development
- [AIUL-CD-TR](/aiul/combinations/cd-tr.html) - Traditional media with conceptual development
- [AIUL-CD-MX](/aiul/combinations/cd-mx.html) - Mixed media with conceptual development
- [AIUL-CD-CO](/aiul/combinations/cd-co.html) - Code with conceptual development

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use AI to outline a paper or project?**  
A: Yes, outlining and structural planning fall under conceptual development.

**Q: Can I use AI to rewrite or edit my final work?**  
A: No, the final execution must be entirely your own work.

**Q: How much detail should I include about AI-assisted research?**  
A: Documentation should be thorough enough to understand how AI influenced your thinking, including key prompts and how the information was incorporated into your conceptual development.
