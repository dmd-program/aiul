**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Released:** December 9, 2025

The AIUL-NA (Not Allowed) license designates assignments where **no AI tools are permitted**. This license is appropriate when the learning objectives specifically include the development of foundational skills without computational assistance.

## License Summary

- **Short Description:** No AI tools allowed. All work must be entirely student-generated.
- **Syllabus Text:** "no AI tools are permitted. All work must be entirely your own without assistance from AI tools."

## Purpose

## Requirements

- May not use AI generation tools for any part of the assignment
- Must complete all work using only their own skills and knowledge
- May still use third-party non-AI tools and resources according to standard course policies
